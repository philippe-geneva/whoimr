Measurement requires information on pregnancy status, timing of death (during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy), and cause of death.The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated directly from data collected through vital registration systems, household surveys or other sources. There are often data quality problems, particularly related to the underreporting and misclassification of maternal deaths. Therefore, data are often adjusted in order to take these data quality issues into account.Because maternal mortality is a relatively rare event, large sample sizes are needed if household surveys are used to identify recent maternal deaths in the household (e.g. last year). This may still result in estimates with large confidence intervals, limiting the usefulness for cross-country or over-time comparisons.To reduce sample size requirements, the sisterhood method used in the DHS and multiple indicator surveys (MICS4) measures maternal mortality by asking respondents about the survival of sisters. It should be noted that the sisterhood method results in pregnancy-related mortality: regardless of the cause of death, all deaths occurring during pregnancy, birth or the six weeks following the termination of the pregnancy are included in the numerator of the maternal mortality ratio.Censuses have also included questions about maternal deaths with variable success.Reproductive Age Mortality Studies (RAMOS) is a special study that uses varied sources, depending on the context, to identify all deaths of women of reproductive age and ascertain which of these deaths are maternal or pregnancy-related.",

This method involves assessment of data for completeness and, where necessary, adjustment for underreporting and misclassification of deaths as well as development of estimates through statistical modelling for countries with no reliable national level data.Data on maternal mortality and other relevant variables are obtained through databases maintained by WHO, the United Nations Population Division, UNICEF, and The World Bank. Data available from countries varies in terms of source and methods. Given the variability of the sources of data, different methods are used for each data source in order to arrive at country estimates that are comparable and permit regional and global aggregation.Currently, only about one third of all countries/territories have reliable data available and do not need additional estimations. For about half of the countries included in the estimation process, country-reported estimates of maternal mortality are adjusted for the purposes of comparability of the methodologies. For the remainder of countries/territories - those with no appropriate maternal mortality data - a statistical model is employed to predict maternal mortality levels. However, the calculated point estimates with this methodology might not represent the true levels of maternal mortality. It is advised to consider the estimates together with the reported uncertainty margins within which the true levels are known to lie.Predominant type of statistics: predicted.",

WHO compiles information supplied by ministries of health (i.e. the agencies responsible for malaria surveillance in endemic countries). The procedures for adjusting data to allow for international comparability are as follows: The number of malaria deaths is derived by one of two methods: 1.  by multiplying the estimated number of P. falciparum malaria cases in a country by a fixed case-fatality rate. This method is used for all countries outside the WHO African Region and for countries in the African Region where estimates of case incidence are derived from routine reporting systems and where malaria accounts for less than 5% of all deaths in children under 5 years, as described in the Global Burden of Disease Incremental Revision for 2004. A case fatality rate of 0.45% is applied to the estimated number of P. falciparum cases for countries in the African Region and a case fatality rate of 0.3% for P. falciparum cases in other regions. (In situations where the fraction of all deaths due to malaria is small, the use of a case fatality rate in conjunction with estimates of case incidence is considered to provide a better guide to the levels of malaria mortality than attempts to estimate the fraction of deaths due to malaria.) 2.  For countries in the African Region where malaria comprises 5% or more of all deaths in children under 5 years, the number of deaths is derived from an estimate of the number of people living at high, low or no risk of malaria. Malaria death rates for these populations are inferred from longitudinal studies of malaria deaths, as recorded in the published literature.The malaria death rate is expressed as the number of deaths due to malaria per 100 000 population per year with the population of a country derived from projections made by the United Nations Population Division. The adjustment procedures described above aim to take into account underreporting of cases if patients do not use public sector facilities or if there are gaps in public sector reporting systems. For countries that do not undertake laboratory confirmation of cases, the adjustments also aim to correct for over-diagnosis of malaria. Where data from surveillance systems are not available, or are considered to be of insufficient quality, incidence is derived from estimated levels of malaria risk and will chiefly be from sources other than locally-available estimates.Predominant type of statistics: predicted.Age standardization is done for comparability over time and between populations.",

For some surveys, no retrospective birth histories are available and the estimate is based on the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the survey. -Census data: With census data, the adolescent birth rate is generally computed on the basis of the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the enumeration. The census provides both the numerator and the denominator for the rates. In some cases, the rates based on censuses are adjusted for under-registration based on indirect methods of estimation. For some countries with no other reliable data, the own-children method of indirect estimation provides estimates of the adolescent birth rate for a number of years before the census (See: http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Metadata.aspx, accessed 19 October 2009.)If numbers are available, adolescent fertility at ages under 15 years can also be computed.",

Sampling 4-6 year olds may be appropriate.The serosurvey is cross sectional and therefore a point estimate time. The shorter time periods of data collection are therefore preferred.Data on HBV birth dose exposure and B3 completion should be drawn from official records. Where these are not available testing for HBsAb may be considered for the serosurvey. This is less preferable as it is more costly, but can also be done in addition.Specimen collection and transportation should be appropriate to minimize bias though specimen degradation in rural and remote areas.Where possible, it is advantageous to collect blood specimens for ELISA laboratory testing because the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) is higher than for rapid tests. However in some locations only rapid tests will be available hence test selection is resource dependent. This should be considered in designing overall study methodology.When an appropriate sampling strategy and size are used and quality testing assays and laboratory procedures are employed, the HBsAg prevalence in the serosurvey should be representative of the incidence of childhood HBV transmission in the specific geographic region (or country) in this age group.",

The prevalence of TB is calculated from the product of incidence and duration of disease: prevalence = incidence x duration of the condition.The duration of disease is very difficult to measure directly. It is assumed to vary according to whether the individual receives treatment in a programme following the internationally recommended TB strategy or not, and whether the individual is infected with HIV. Further, durations are assumed to follow distributions with a large variance to account for differences between countries.Further details are available from Tuberculosis prevalence surveys handbook (2nd edition), TB impact measurement: policy and recommendations for how to assess the epidemiological burden of TB and the impact of TB control and in the online technical appendix to the WHO global tuberculosis report.",

Such data will be combined with water quality data from direct testing of water quality at the household level as well as data from administrative records or regulatory frameworks for various aspects of safe management. The percentage of the total population using a safely managed drinking-water service is the population-weighted average of the previous two numbers. Access to water and sanitation are considered core socioeconomic and health indicators and key determinants of, inter alia, child survival, maternal and children’s health, family well-being and economic productivity. Additionally, the use of drinking-water sources and sanitation facilities is part of the wealth index used by household surveys to divide the population into wealth quintiles. As a result, most nationally representative household surveys include information about basic water and sanitation. The survey questions and response categories pertaining to access to basic drinking-water sources are fully harmonized between DHS and MICS and are adopted from the standard questionnaire promoted for inclusion in survey instruments by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme on Water Supply and Sanitation. This can be accessed via www.wssinfo.org.

A linear trend line, based on the least-squares method, is drawn through these data points to provide estimates of use of basic drinking-water sources for all years between 1990 and the present year (wherever possible). This is based on the MDG baseline year of 1990, and therefore will be modified based on the agreed baseline for the SDGs. Estimates of faecal and chemical contamination, and regulation by appropriate authorities, will be collected from countries and used to adjust the data on use of basic drinking-water sources as needed.Population data used, including the proportion of the population living in urban and rural areas, are those established by the United Nations Population Division.Predominant type of statistics: adjusted and predicted.",

Such data will be combined with data from administrative records or regulatory frameworks for various aspects of safe management. The percentage of the total population using an improved sanitation facility is the population weighted average of the previous two numbers. Access to water and sanitation are considered core socioeconomic and health indicators and key determinants of, inter alia, child survival, maternal and children’s health, family well-being and economic productivity. Additionally the use of drinking-water sources and sanitation facilities is part of the wealth index used by household surveys to divide the population into wealth quintiles. As a result, most nationally representative household surveys include information about basic water and sanitation. The survey questions and response categories pertaining to access to basic sanitation facilities are fully harmonized between DHS and MICS and are adopted from the standard questionnaire promoted for inclusion in survey instruments by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme on Water Supply and Sanitation. This can be accessed via www.vwssinfo.org.

This is based on the MDG baseline year of 1990, and therefore will be modified based on the agreed baseline for the SDGs. Estimates of excreta management, and regulation by appropriate authorities, will be collected from countries and used to adjust the data on use of basic sanitation facilities as needed. Administrative, population (including population density) and environmental data can be combined to estimate safe disposal or transport of excreta, when no country data are available.

The model accounts only for regions, countries and time as a spline function, and estimates were restricted to values ranging from zero to one. All analyses were conducted using STATA software (version 12, StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). Estimates for countries with no available surveys were obtained as follows: When no information on the fuels and technologies use in the home was available for the country, the regional population-weighted mean was used. Note that this approach was also applied to Equatorial Guinea instead of the one used for high-income countries (see below); Countries classified as high-income with a Gross National Income (GNI) of more than US$ 12 616 per capita (The World Bank, http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications, accessed July 2013) are assumed to have made a complete transition to using modern fuels and technologies as the primary source of domestic energy for cooking and heating, and solid fuel use is reported to be less than 5%.",

With paper-based systems, the National Tuberculosis Control Programme and National AIDS Control Programme should refer to both the TB and HIV registers to obtain the complete number of patients detected. This can be done by counting the total number of new and relapse TB patients added to the TB register during in a specified time period who had their HIV status documented as positive, including patients previously known to be HIV-positive (e.g. documented evidence of enrolment in HIV care). Cases with undocumented TB treatment history should be counted as new cases.The National Tuberculosis Control Programme and National AIDS Control Programme should ensure that the TB register is updated and that all people living with HIV in pre-ART care or on ART who have a recorded TB diagnosis during the reporting period are also registered. Information in the TB and ART registers at facility level should be reconciled monthly or quarterly, taking into account the possibility of time lags in updating TB information in the ART register and ART information in the TB register. Efforts should be made to update such missing data so that both registers are consistent. Care should be taken to avoid double counting of patients across these registers.",
